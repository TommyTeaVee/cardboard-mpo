# MPO image viewer for Google Cardboard

This is a simple app for viewing 3D MPO images on your Android device using Google Cardboard!

## Features

- Automatically scans your internal memory and external SD card for all .MPO pictures, and shows them in sequence.
- Press the trigger button on your Cardboard to advance to the next image.
- Renders the images using OpenGL ES 2.0, via the Cardboard SDK, to take advantage of automatic barrel distortion and offset.
